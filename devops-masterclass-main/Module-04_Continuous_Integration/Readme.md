# Continuous Integration (CI)

## Continous Intrgation Overview

- Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run.
- Continuous integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both an automation component (e.g. a CI or build service) and a cultural component (e.g. learning to integrate frequently).
- The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.

### Why is Continuous Integration Needed?

- In the past, developers on a team might work in isolation for an extended period of time and only merge their changes to the master branch once their work was completed.
- This made merging code changes difficult and time-consuming, and also resulted in bugs accumulating for a long time without correction.
- These factors made it harder to deliver updates to customers quickly.

### How does Continuous Integration Work?

- With continuous integration, developers frequently commit to a shared repository using a version control system such as Git.
- Prior to each commit, developers may choose to run local unit tests on their code as an extra verification layer before integrating.
- A continuous integration service automatically builds and runs unit tests on the new code changes to immediately surface any errors.
