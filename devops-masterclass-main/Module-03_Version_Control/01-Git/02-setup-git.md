# Setup Git

## Pre-requisites
   - Git must be installed on your system.

## Configure Git
   - First in order to check if the Git is properly installed, open the command prompt/shell and execute below command:
     ```
     git --version

     # Above command should give you current installed version of the Git; something like this
     git version 2.41.0.windows.3
     
     ```
          
   - To configure Git, you must define some global variables: `user.name` and `user.email`. Both are required for you to make commits.
   - Set the `user.name` configuration variable with the below command:
     ```
     git config --global user.name "<USER_NAME>"

     # Replace <USER_NAME> with the user name you want to use.

     ```
     
   - Now, set the `user.email` configuration variable with the below command:
     ```
     git config --global user.email "<USER_EMAIL>"
     
     # Replace <USER_EMAIL> with your e-mail address
     ```
   
   - You may run the following command to check that your name and email info are saved:
     ```
     git config --list

     or

     git config -l

     # You must see user.name and user.email variables updated with your details
     ```
## Setup your Git Repository
   - Git works by checking for changes to files within a certain folder.
   - So let's create a folder to serve as our project directory and let Git know about it, so it can start tracking changes.
   - Start by creating an empty folder for your project, and then initialize a Git repository inside it:
     ```
     # Create a folder
     mkdir <DIRECTORY_NAME>

     # Change the directory to our project directory
     cd <DIRECTORY_NAME>
     ```
   - Now, initialize your new repository and set the name of the default branch to main:
     ```
     git init --initial-branch=main

     or

     git init -b main
     ```
     After initializing the repository, you should see output similar to this example:</br></br>
     Initialized empty Git repository in /home/<user>/repository_name/.git/ </br>
     Switched to a new branch 'main'
   - Now, use a `git status` command to show the status of the working tree:
     
     ```
     git status
     ```
     
## Get help from Git (man pages)
   - Git has a built-in `help` function that you can use to look up commands and keywords.
     
     ```
     git --help

     # You may read through the different options available with Git and note that each command comes with its own help page 
     ```
   - Git Help: Examples
     ```
     # To get help around git commit command
     git commit --help

     # To get help around git clone command
     git clone --help
     ```
