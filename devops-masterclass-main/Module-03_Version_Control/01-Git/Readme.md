# Git 101

## What is `Git`?

- Git is most widely used version control system in the world.
- Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds.
- Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (Distributed Version Control System).
- Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

## What can you do with the `Git`?

Developers can review project history to find out:

- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?

## Why `Git` for Version control?

- Git has the functionality, performance, security and flexibility that most teams and individual developers need.
- Significant numbers of developers already have Git experience.
- Git is a quality open source project.
